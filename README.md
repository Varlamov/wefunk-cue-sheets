CUE Sheets for WEFUNK RADIO Shows http://wefunkradio.com/


# usage
you can use the cue sheets for example with mp3splt, as follows:
mp3splt -o "@n2 - @a - @t" -d 764 -c WeFunk_Show_761_2013-12-13.cue WeFunk_Show_761_2013-12-13.mp3

it creates a directory for the show and splits the mp3 lossless.


for windows there is also a gui version http://mp3splt.sourceforge.net/
